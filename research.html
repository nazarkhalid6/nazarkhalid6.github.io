            India has the world’s largest number of school-aged children. The majority live in rural
            areas, many of which are highly flood-prone. Previous studies document that in such
            areas, floods are associated with lower enrollments, attendance, and learning, in some
            cases with differentiation by gender, caste/religion, and family SES. Previous
            literature suggests that components of community infrastructure have positive
            associations with children’s learning. However, previous literature has not addressed
            whether better community physical and social infrastructures are associated with (1)
            smaller flood-related learning losses on average, (2) different learning for
            marginalized versus other children in the absence of floods, and (3) different
            vulnerabilities to floods for marginalized versus other children. This paper finds that
            (1) most aspects of community physical and social infrastructure are not associated with
            lower flood-related learning losses on average, but proximity to towns and several
            components of social infrastructure are associated with lower flood-related learning
            losses on average, (2) community physical and social infrastructure components have
            heterogeneous associations, in some cases increasing, in most cases not affecting, and
            in other cases reducing disparities in learning between marginalized and other children
            in the absence of floods, and (3) community physical and social infrastructure
            components have heterogeneous effects, in some cases increasing, in most cases not
            affecting, and in other cases reducing disparities in learning between marginalized and
            other children in the presence of floods.

            Floods cause extensive damage in high-income countries, including the United States, but
            problems are more severe in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) that lack
            preventative and mitigating infrastructure. Marginalized children’s education in LMICs
            might be particularly vulnerable. Using the Indian Human Development Survey, we
            investigate flood exposure implications for the education of school-age rural children,
            paying particular attention to children from marginalized groups. Results show that
            lower-caste Hindu, Muslim, and poorer children with less-educated parents in
            agricultural households are more likely to experience flooding. Interactions between
            flooding and marginalization characteristics indicate that flood exposure is associated
            with disproportionately negative learning outcomes for girls and that economic resources
            may mitigate flood exposure effects on delayed school progress. While greater exposures
            for marginalized groups are concerning, the limited number and modest magnitudes of
            documented negative effect heterogeneities for marginalized children are somewhat better
            news.

            Exposure to air pollution from cooking with solid fuels has important consequences for
            public health. This paper focuses on rural north India, where despite robust economic
            growth and government subsidies, the vast majority of households mainly use solid fuels.
            We draw on new qualitative and quantitative data collected in the context of a policy
            environment that dramatically expanded ownership of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) to
            examine why households are slow to adopt clean fuels in rural north India. We find that
            patriarchal gender norms and attitudes encourage the use of solid fuels in this region.
            North Indian society confers low status to women, promotes women’s seclusion, and
            constrains women’s engagement in economic activities outside of the home. These beliefs
            encourage women to preserve gas, promote women’s work that facilitates the use of solid
            fuels, and hinder communication between the cook and the decision-maker regarding LPG
            refills. When rural north Indian households use gas, it is frequently to facilitate the
            adherence to norms of seclusion that prevent women from leaving the home to collect
            solid fuels. In addition to expanding access and improving economic conditions, future
            research and policy interventions should pay careful attention to the gender norms and
            attitudes that discourage the use of gas. Addressing these beliefs and norms is
            essential to sustained LPG use and health improvements.

            In high-income countries, population health surveys often measure mental health. This is
            less common in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including in India, where
            mental health is under-researched relative to its disease burden. The objective of this
            study is to assess the performance of two questionnaires for measuring population mental
            health in a mobile phone survey. We adapt the Kessler-6 screening questionnaire and the
            World Health Organization’s Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ) for a mobile phone survey
            in the Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand and Maharashtra. The questionnaires differ in
            the symptoms they measure and in the number of response options offered. Questionnaires
            are randomly assigned to respondents. We consider a questionnaire to perform well if it
            identifies geographic and demographic disparities in mental health that are consistent
            with the literature and does not suffer from selective non-response. Both questionnaires
            measured less mental distress in Maharashtra than in Bihar and Jharkhand, which is
            consistent with Maharashtra’s higher human development indicators. The adapted SRQ, but
            not the adapted Kessler-6, identified women as having worse mental health than men in
            all three states. Conclusions about population mental health based on the adapted
            Kessler-6 are likely to be influenced by low response rates (about 82% across the three
            samples). Respondents were different from non-respondents: non-respondents were less
            educated and more likely to be female. The SRQ’s higher response rate (about 94% across
            the three states) may reflect the fact that it was developed for use in LMICs and that
            it focuses on physical, rather than emotional, symptoms, which may be less stigmatized.

            The 2011 India Human Development Survey found that in about a quarter of Indian
            households, women are expected to have their meals after men have finished eating. This
            study investigates whether this form of gender discrimination is associated with worse
            mental health outcomes for women. Our primary data source is a new, state-representative
            mobile phone survey of women ages 18–65 in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Maharashtra in 2018.
            We measure mental health using questions from the World Health Organization’s
            Self-Reporting Questionnaire. We find that, for women in these states, eating last is
            correlated with worse mental health, even after accounting for differences in
            socioeconomic status. We discuss two possible mechanisms for this relationship: eating
            last may be associated with worse mental health because it is associated with worse
            physical health, or eating last may be associated with poor mental health because it is
            associated with less autonomy, or both.

            We present results from a new representative telephonic survey, which confirms
            persistence of conservative gender and caste attitudes. In particular, we find that high
            proportions of men and women in all of the social groups we study disapprove of women
            working outside the home, say that it is acceptable for husbands to beat their wives,
            and would object to relatives marrying a Dalit person. By analyzing data from the
            National Family Health Survey and the India Human Development Survey, we see that the
            outcomes associated with these attitudes are even more conservative: a smaller fraction
            of women work than those who say it is acceptable, a larger fraction of women experience
            violence in marriage than men who say it is acceptable, and an even smaller fraction of
            people have intercaste marriages than people who say they would not oppose. With a few
            exceptions, the attitudes and outcomes we study vary surprisingly little by respondent
            gender, caste, and religion. Dr Ambedkar’s legacy is indeed unfinished – people from all
            backgrounds must continue to work for the equality and dignity of women and Dalits.

            Revisiting Open Defecation: Evidence from a Panel Survey in Rural North India, 2014–18

            Since October 2014, the Government of India has worked towards the goal of eliminating
            open defecation by 2019 through the Swachh Bharat Mission. In June 2014, the results of
            a survey of rural sanitation behaviour in North India were first reported. The results
            from a late 2018 survey that revisited households from the 2014 survey in four
            states—Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh—are presented. Although rural
            latrine ownership increased considerably over this period, open defecation remains very
            common in these four states. There is substantial heterogeneity across states in what
            the SBM did and how. These outcomes suggest the need for a transparent, fact-based
            public dialogue about the SBM, its costs and benefits, and its accomplishments and
            means.

            We study patterns of cooking fuel use in rural north India, focusing on households that
            have access to LPG but continue to use wood or dung. The analysis highlights how fuel
            stacking, affordability constraints, and supply interruptions contribute to the
            persistence of solid fuel use, underscoring the need for policies that address both
            access and sustained use.

            Combining survey questions on everyday treatment with items on perceived discrimination,
            this paper examines how Dalit and Muslim respondents in north India describe and label
            their experiences. We show that discriminatory acts are common, but are not always named
            as “discrimination,” revealing gaps between lived experience and reported perceptions
            that matter for policy and politics.

            We study the rollout of Aadhaar-based biometric authentication in the public distribution
            system (PDS) in Jharkhand. Drawing on household survey data and field interviews, the
            paper documents both reductions in some forms of leakage and new barriers to access,
            including authentication failures and increased transaction costs for poor households.
            The findings raise concerns about exclusion in technology-mediated welfare systems.
